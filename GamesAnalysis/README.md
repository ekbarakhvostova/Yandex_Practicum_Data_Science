# GamesAnalysis 


## Task
To identify patterns that determine the success of the game, which will allow you to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

## Conclusion
An online store that sells computer games worldwide provided historical data from open sources about game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms.
I selected the current period for data analysis for current interest forecast and  determined the parameters of success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed.
I determined TOP-5 potentially profitable platforms, the average "lifespan" of the platform on which games are released was revealed, portraits of users in each region.
I checked the hypotheses about the equality of the mean of two general populations for the samples taken from them:
- average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same (there is a 14.7% chance that the average revenue from the XOne platform is equal to the average user rating of games on the PC platform);
- Average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different (High probability that the average user rating for Action games differs from the average user rating for Sports games).
