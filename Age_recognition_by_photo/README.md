## Task
Development of a regression model that should be able to determine the age of customers from a photo taken in the checkout area of ​​a store.

## Conclusion
To work on the project, the following were provided: a marked up table with the names of photographs, a target attribute and a folder with images.
I developed a model with the ResNet50 architecture, training was carried out on 10 epochs, and the training set was augmented.
On the test sample, we managed to achieve MAE 6.51.
